# <p align="center"> 🤖 Fundamentals of AI and Chatbot with IBM Watson Assistant - Machine Learning

This repository contains the projects that I developed during the course Fundamentals of AI and Chatbot with IBM Watson Assistant at Impact University of Technology . In this course, I learned how to create and integrate chatbots using IBM Watson, an artificial intelligence platform that allows building conversational solutions with Machine Learning.


I hope you enjoy and learn from these examples. If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact me.

Thank you for visiting this repository!
