### <p align="center">  💪🏽Empowered AI No-Code Chatbot

This repository contains the projects that I developed during the course Fundamentals of AI and Chatbot with IBM Watson Assistant at Impact University of Technology . In this course, I learned how to create and integrate chatbots using IBM Watson, an artificial intelligence platform that allows building conversational solutions with Machine Learning.
  
I hope you enjoy and learn from these examples. If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact me.
 
Thank you for visiting this repository!
